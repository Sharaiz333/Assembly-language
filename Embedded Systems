;This code uses the ARM instruction set and demonstrates basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder
; Addition
MOV R0, 5; Load 5 into register R0
MOV R1, 3; Load 3 into register R1
ADD R2, R0, R1; R2 = R0 + R1
; R2 now contains the result of the addition (8)

; Subtraction
MOV R0, 10; Load 10 into register R0
MOV R1, 4; Load 4 into register R1
SUB R2, R0, R1; R2 = R0 - R1
; R2 now contains the result of the subtraction (6)

; Multiplication
MOV R0, 7; Load 7 into register R0
MOV R1, 2; Load 2 into register R1
MUL R2, R0, R1; R2 = R0 * R1
; R2 now contains the result of the multiplication (14)

; Division
MOV R0, 12; Load 12 into register R0
MOV R1, 3; Load 3 into register R1
DIV R2, R0, R1; R2 = R0 / R1
; R2 now contains the result of the division (4)

; Modulus (Remainder)
MOV R0, 17; Load 17 into register R0
MOV R1, 5; Load 5 into register R1
MOD R2, R0, R1; R2 = R0 % R1
; R2 now contains the result of the modulus operation (2)
